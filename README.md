<h1>Goals:</h1>

- become a better developer

- build helpful tools and contribute to the community

- learn to implement and deploy different technologies in exciting, practical, and interesting ways.

<h1>Projects:</h1>

- Built and maintain a couple powershell module available via the Powershell Gallery known as Get-DMARCRecord and Powershell.Base64. They do exactly what what they sound like. Open-sourced here, on my github. 🕵️📖🛡️

- Designed various Python integrations for use with Palo Alto XSOAR to interface with the Cisco Ironport API version 15.6 and higher. These automations have enabled security analysts at my organization to react faster to incidents, and be proactive about our email security posture. 🐍

- Implemented SSO for all the things. Using both Okta and Entra Id/AzureAD as identity providers, have engineered all role levels across infosec and IT organizations based on principal of least privilege with SAML assertions from Okta/Entra ID. 📖🪪

- Implemented Physical Security Key security policies for business-critical administrative accounts and admin roles, ensuring high levels of authentication strength for admin-level accounts at several organizations. 🔐

- Built automations using powershell to ensure all Windows devices entering the environment are Bitlocker encrypted, logging all Bitlocker recovery keys for offsite storage and logging reason to include encryption failure on any device unable to start Bitlocker encryption. Useful for networks/endpoints with compliance obligations. 🛡️

- Built various OpenAI API wrappers for interacting with the OpenAI Completions, Responses, and Assistants endpoints through a chat interface in-console (such as command prompt, python terminal, bash-- etc.)-- intended for use with several GPT-x models via the OpenAI API. 🤖

- Successfully staged and operated Multi-Factor Authentication campaigns for multiple orgs up to 50,000 users at a time, implementing Multi-factor Authentication for end users in environments where there was previously none. 🛅

- Fun powershell module to get the current locale's weather using OpenWeatherMap API and public WAN IP address. ⛅
